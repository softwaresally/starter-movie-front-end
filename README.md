# WeLoveMovies Frontend Application

This application was developed using Render as a web service, React, JavaScript, Knex, Node.js, Express.js, RESTful API, PostgreSQL

Please note this site will have slow load times!! This website uses Render's free web service. The database is stored on ElephantSQL, so load times can be slow. I appreciate your patience!

The home page will show you all movies that are "Now Showing".
